We now switch gears and use Recurrent Neural Networks, and in particular LSTMs, to perform sentiment analysis in Keras. Conveniently, Keras has a built-in [IMDb movie reviews dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification) that we can use, with the same vocabulary size."
